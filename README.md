# stock_data_analysis
I present an algorithm using VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.
The goal of this analysis was to find how much stock prices changed comparing the first open price of the year vs. the last close price of the year. Excel VBA was used to perform the analysis across multiple worksheets.
